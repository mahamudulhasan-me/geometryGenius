            <strong>Question-1:</strong> What is DOM and what is the purpose of
            DOM?
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">
            <strong>Answer:</strong>
            DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface
            through which the structure, style and content of web pages can be
            changed. That is, a web page can be made interactive through DOM.
            <br />
            The purpose of the DOM is to provide a way for programs, such as
            JavaScript, to access and manipulate the elements and content of a
            web page. Through DOM we can manipulate data like data insert delete
            etc without page reload.That is, through DOM, we can easily make a
            webpage dynamic and create a responsive web application.

            <strong>Question-2:</strong> How will you select HTML elements using
            DOM? Name the DOM methods.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">
            <strong>Answer:</strong>
            To select HTML elements using DOM, we can use a variety of DOM
            methods. Here are some common DOM methods for selecting elements:
            <br />
            <strong> getElementById():</strong> This method selects an element
            by its id <br />

            <strong>getElementsByClassName():</strong> This method selects
            elements by their class attribute. <br />
            <strong>getElementsByTagName():</strong>
            This method selects elements by their tag name. <br />
            <strong>querySelector(): </strong>This method selects the first
            element that matches a CSS selector <br />
            <strong>querySelectorAll():</strong> This method selects all
            elements that match a CSS selector <br />
            <strong>parentElement():</strong> This method selects the parent
            element of an element. <br />
            <strong>children():</strong> This method selects the child elements
            of an element. <br />
            <strong>nextSibling(): </strong> This method selects the next
            sibling element of an element. <br />
            <strong> previousSibling():</strong> This method selects the
            previous sibling element of an element. <br />
            The HTML element can be selected through the above methods. When to
            use any method depends on our work.

            <strong>Question-3:</strong> What is event bubble?
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">
            <strong>Answer:</strong> Event bubbling is a system in the
            javascript event model where the event is fired on a nested child
            element handler that is contained by parent elements. <br />
            when an event is executed on a component such as a click on a button
            the event starts at the target element and bubbles up through the
            parent elements. During this process, any event handlers that stay
            in their target element container or any of the ancestor elements
            can be triggered.

            <strong>Question-4:</strong> What is a callback function and why
            will you use it?
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">
            <strong>Answer:</strong>
            A callback function is a function expression in JavaScript. which
            acts as an argument to a function and executes itself. That is,
            callback function is a function that is called back by another
            function when some event occurs or when a certain task is completed.
            <br />
            Callback functions are commonly used in JavaScript, especially when
            working with asynchronous tasks such as fetching data from a server
            or performing animations.
